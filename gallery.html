            The following eight sections are my past adventures, featuring my education, internship experience, <br>
            engineering projects, presentation, my attempts at arts and design, leadership experience, honors and <br>
            awards, and extracurricular activities. You can have a thorough view of what I have done in the past three <br> 
            years and hopefully know more about me!<br>

            As this is a relatively early stage of this project, these tabs are not deployed to link with another page. <br>
            But eventually, these galleries will lead to fun projects that I've completed before with more vivid contents.
