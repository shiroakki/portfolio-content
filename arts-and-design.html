        <p>
            I have a profound interest in arts and design, including painting, photography and digital graphic design.
            <br>
            Below are some of my art collections that marked my creative process.

            Photography
        </h2>
        <p>
            I started to capture the world as I see it after graduating from high school, when I owned my first Canon.
            <br>
            That could be described as my first encounter with digital art creation. I began to be amazed by the
            <br>light-and-shadow effects, as well as the fresh colors produced by photosensitive elements in the <br>
            camera. Attached below are some of my favorite photos along the journey.
        </p>

                <li> <img src="images/photography1.jpg" alt="Photography1" /></li>
                <li> <img src="images/photography2.jpg" alt="Photography2" /></li>

            Painting
        </h2  >
        <p>
            I observe and feel the way the texture of canvas and my paint brush interact through painting. I started
            <br>
            painting watercolors when I was in primary school, when I was fascinated by Japanese anime and the cool
            characters. <br>
            Gradually I became interested in oil painting and classics because that was how the majority of masterpieces
            in art
            history were created.<br>
            The ultimate and most courageous attempt I took was to paint a friend's wall--literally her wall upon which
            she <br>
            would have to stare for every single day. My adventure with painting has never stopped--recently I began to
            draw on
            <br>Procreate, which is a brand new experience, with all the cool features and vivid simulation of
            real-world rendering <br>
            effects. I really hope someday I could curate my own galleryâ€¦
