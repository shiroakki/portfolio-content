            My primary role at RMLab was as a research intern. The goal is to find innovative, machine learning-supported 
            <br>
            ways to address mental disorders such as bipolar disorder and anxiety. I designed experiments to seek biometric
            <br>
            identifiers such as heart rate variability and sleep patterns to predict treatment-resistant depression from 
            
            <br>wearable devices using machine learning algorithms.

            I worked in Coca Cola CPS as a strategic sourcing intern for six months. I helped make strategic decisions <br>
            with respect to company sales and needs, focusing on maximizing commercial profits as well as optimizing 
            <br>sustainability practices. The main tool I used was Python and MS Excel.
